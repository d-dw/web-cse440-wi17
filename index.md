# Course Description

This course provides an introduction to human-computer interaction and the design process. 
It is overwhelmingly organized around a group project, in which students:

This course provides an introduction to human-computer interaction and the design process.
Students will learn methods and skills for designing and prototyping interactive systems.
The course covers a design process from the initial formulation of a design problem to creation of digital prototypes.
Course structure is a mix of lectures, classroom activities, and design critiques by peers and course staff.
The course is overwhelmingly organized around a group project, in which students:

- Ideate and Propose Design Problems
- Study Existing Practices and Challenges
- Explore Potential Design Opportunities and Tradeoffs
- Evaluate and Improve a Design
- Communicate their Problem and Resulting Design

````
## Learning Objectives

- Process-focused perspective on interaction design
- Design methods and skills

# Project Theme

`to be updated to emphasize tracking beyond the 'self'`

Projects are exploring challenges and opportunities in self-tracking, also known as Personal Informatics:

> Personal informatics systems are systems that help people collect personally relevant information for the purpose of 
> self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge.
>
> [Li _et al._, 2010]({{ site.baseurl }}/readings/PersonalInformatics-Li2010.pdf).

Personal informatics relates heavily to the [Quantified Self](http://quantifiedself.com/) movement, which emphasizes:

> Self-knowledge through numbers.
>
> [Gary Wolf, 2009](http://archive.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/17-07/lbnp_knowthyself)

People have long sought to better understand themselves, but recently technology advances are enabling fundamentally new approaches. 
Students will examine the problems people encounter, then explore how new technology can go beyond the data fetish to help people in reaching their goals. 

# Project Structure

Projects are organized around four assignments, each consistent of several milestones:

- [Assignment 1 - Project Proposal]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment1/)
- [Assignment 2 - Getting the Right Design]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment2/)
- [Assignment 3 - Getting the Design Right]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment3/)
- [Assignment 4 - Communicating the Design]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment4/)

Example project from prior offerings include: 

- [Aqueous](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/14au/projects/aqueous/)
- [IEP Connect](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/14au/projects/iepconnect/)
- [Ka-Ching](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/14au/projects/kaching/)
- [Soundscape](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/14au/projects/soundscape/)

Note that details of assignments may have changed since prior offerings, so their reports may not map to the current project.
However, these represent examples of strong work in this course.

# Grading

Strive to do good work because you care about your own opportunities to learn,
including the opportunities this course provides in working with a group in an intensive project.

The overall course grade will be computed as follows:

- Group Project (__65%__)
  - Assignment 1, Project Proposal (__3%__)
  - Assignment 2, Getting the Right Design (__21%__)
    - Milestones (__6%__)
    - Final Report (__15%__)
  - Assignment 3, Getting the Design Right (__14%__)
    - Milestones (__4%__)
    - Final Report (__10%__)
  - Assignment 4, Communicating the Design (__15%__)
    - Milestones (__3%__)
    - Project Website (__4%__)
    - Video Prototype (__4%__)
    - Poster (__4%__)
  - Presentations (__12%__)
    - Getting the Right Design Presentation (__5%__)
    - Getting the Design Right Presentation (__5%__)
    - Individual Presentation Score (__2%__)
- Exam (__25%__)
- Individual Readings (__5%__)
- Participation (__5%__)

Each assignment will also provide a point breakdown intended to convey how it will be graded. 
Design is an inherently subjective practice, and so grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
The stated project requirements are the minimum, leaving room for groups to wow us with your work.

Because the course is designed around feedback on project milestones, grades given to those milestones indicate
that you have invested sufficient effort and insight at the time of the milestone.
You will get feedback and are expected to continue acting upon that feedback in your design process.
The bulk of project grades is therefore attached to the final deliverables, which are evaluated on their quality.

We expect groups to resolve any coordination issues, and we expect concerns to be raised so they can be addressed.
The course staff is always happy to make suggestions with regard to your coordination and effort.
If necessary, we reserve the right adjusting an individual's grade with regard to the group project.

# Submission

Many assignments are due "the night before class". We will implement this in Canvas as 4:00am.

In order to be prepared to give you feedback, the course staff must have your submission in the morning.
Submitting the day of class, just before class, or in class is therefore unacceptable, risking zero credit.

Submissions should be in PDF format (i.e., not plain text, not Word). 
The PDF should be 'printable', containing everything we need to review and grade the assignment (e.g., your name).
The course staff has a large number of submissions to manage, so format and completeness issues are problematic.
