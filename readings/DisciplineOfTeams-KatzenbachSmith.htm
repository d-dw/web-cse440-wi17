<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><big><big>E</big></big></strong>arly in the 1980s, Bill Greenwood and a small

band of rebel railroaders took on most of the top management of Burlington Northern and

created a multibillion-dollar business in "piggybacking" rail services despite

widespread resistance, even resentment, within the company. The Medical Products Group at

Hewlett-Packard owes most of its leading performance to the remarkable efforts of Dean

Morton, Lew Platt, Ben Holmes, Dick Alberting, and a handful of their colleagues who

revitalized a health care business that most others had written off. At Knight-Ridder, Jim

Batten's "customer obsession" vision took root at the <em>Tallahassee Democrat</em>

when 14 frontline enthusiasts turned a charter to eliminate errors into a mission of major

change and took the entire paper along with them.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Such are the stories and the work of teams - real teams that perform, not amorphous

groups that we call teams because we think that the label is motivating and energizing.

The difference between teams that perform and other groups that don't is a subject to

which most of us pay far too little attention. Part of the problem is that <em>team</em>

is a word and concept so familiar to everyone.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Or at least that's what we thought when we set out to do research for our book <em>The

Wisdom of Teams</em>. We wanted to discover what differentiates various levels of team

performance, where and how teams work best, and what top management can do to enhance

their effectiveness. We talked with hundreds of people on more than 50 different teams in

30 companies and beyond, from Motorola and Hewlett-Packard to Operation Desert Storm and

the Girl Scouts.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">We found that there is a basic discipline that makes teams work. We also found that

teams and good performance are inseparable; you cannot have one without the other. But

people use the word team so loosely that it gets in the way of learning and applying the

discipline that leads to good performance. For managers to make better decisions about

whether, when, or how to encourage and use teams, it is important to be more precise about

what a team is and what it isn't.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Most executives advocate teamwork. And they should. Teamwork represents a set of values

that encourage listening and responding constructively to views expressed by others,

giving others the benefit of the doubt, providing support, and recognizing the interests

and achievements of others. Such values help teams perform, and they also promote

individual performance as well as the performance of an entire organization. But teamwork

values by themselves are not exclusive to teams, nor are they enough to ensure team

performance.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Nor is a team just any group working together. Committees, councils, and task forces

are not necessarily teams. Groups do not become teams simply because that is what someone

calls them. The entire work force of any large and complex organization is <em>never</em>

a team, but think about how often that platitude is offered up.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">To understand how teams deliver extra performance, we must distinguish between teams

and other forms of working groups. That distinction turns on performance results. A

working group's performance is a function of what its members do as individuals. A team's

performance includes both individual results and what we call "collective

work-products." A collective work-product is what two or more members must work on

together, such as interviews, surveys, or experiments. Whatever it is, a collective

work-product reflects the joint, real contribution of team members.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Working groups are both prevalent and effective in large organizations where individual

accountability is most important. The best working groups come together to share

information, perspectives, and insights; to make decisions that help each person do his or

her job better; and to reinforce individual performance standards. But the focus is always

on individual goals and accountabilities. Working group members don't take responsibility

for results other than their own. Nor do they try to develop incremental performance

contributions requiring the combined work of two or more members.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Teams differ fundamentally from working groups because they require both individual and

mutual accountability. Teams rely on more than group discussion, debate, and decision; on

more than sharing information and best practice performance standards. Teams produce

discrete work-products through the joint contributions of their members. This is what

makes possible performance levels greater than the sum of all the individual bests of team

members. Simply stated, a team is more than the sum of its parts.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">The first step in developing a disciplined approach to team management is to think

about teams as discrete units of performance and not just as positive sets of values.

Having observed and worked with scores of teams in action, both successes and failures, we

offer the following. Think of it as a working definition or, better still, an essential

discipline that real teams share.</font></p>



<blockquote>

<font face="Times New Roman">  </font><p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>A team is a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a

  common purpose, set of performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves

  mutually accountable.</em></font></p>

</blockquote>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><big><big>T</big></big></strong>he essence of a team is common commitment.

Without it, groups perform as individuals; with it, they become a powerful unit of

collective performance. This kind of commitment requires a purpose in which team members

can believe. Whether the purpose is to "transform the contributions of suppliers into

the satisfaction of customers," to "make our company one we can be proud of

again," or to "prove that all children can learn," credible team purposes

have an element related to winning, being first, revolutionizing, or being on the cutting

edge.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Teams develop direction, momentum, and commitment by working to shape a meaningful

purpose. Building ownership and commitment to team purpose, however, is not incompatible

with taking initial direction from outside the team. The often asserted assumption that a

team cannot "own" its purpose unless management leaves it alone actually

confuses more potential teams than it helps. In fact, it is the exceptional case - for

example, entrepreneurial situations - when a team creates a purpose entirely on its own.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Most successful teams shape their purposes in response to a demand or opportunity put

in their path, usually by higher management. This helps teams get started by broadly

framing the company's performance expectation. Management is responsible for clarifying

the charter, rationale, and performance challenge for the team, but management must also

leave enough flexibility for the team to develop commitment around its own spin on that

purpose, set of specific goals, timing, and approach.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">The best teams invest a tremendous amount of time and effort exploring, shaping, and

agreeing on a purpose that belongs to them both collectively and individually. This

"purposing" activity continues throughout the life of the team. In contrast,

failed teams rarely develop a common purpose. For whatever reason - an insufficient focus

on performance, lack of effort, poor leadership - they do not coalesce around a

challenging aspiration</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">The best teams also translate their common purpose into specific performance goals,

such as reducing the reject rate from suppliers by 50% or increasing the math scores of

graduates from 40 % to 95 %. Indeed, if a team fails to establish specific performance

goals or if those goals do not relate directly to the team's overall purpose, team members

become confused, pull apart, and revert to mediocre performance. By contrast, when

purposes and goals build on one another and are combined with team commitment, they become

a powerful engine of performance.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Transforming broad directives into specific and measurable performance goals is the

surest first step for a team trying to shape a purpose meaningful to its members. Specific

goals, such as getting a new product to market in less than half the normal time,

responding to all customers within 24 hours, or achieving a zero-defect rate while

simultaneously cutting costs by 40%, all provide firm footholds for teams. There are

several reasons: 



</font></p><ul>

<font face="Times New Roman">  <li>Specific team performance goals help to define a set of work-products that are different

    both from an organization-wide mission and from individual job objectives. As a result,

    such work-products require the collective effort of team members to make something

    specific happen that, in and of itself, adds real value to results. By contrast, simply

    gathering from time to time to make decisions will not sustain team performance.</li>

  <li>The specificity of performance objectives facilitates clear communication and

    constructive conflict within the team. When a plant-level team, for example, sets a goal

    of reducing average machine changeover time to two hours, the clarity of the goal forces

    the team to concentrate on what it would take either to achieve or to reconsider the goal.

    When such goals are clear, discussions can focus on how to pursue them or whether to

    change them; when goals arc ambiguous or nonexistent, such discussions are much less

    productive.</li>

  <li>The attainability of specific goals helps teams maintain their focus on getting results.

    A productdevelopment team at Ell Lilly's Peripheral Systems Division set definite

    yardsticks for the market introduction of an ultrasonic probe to help doctors locate deep

    veins and arteries. The probe had to have an audible signal through a specified depth of

    tissue, be capable of being manufactured at a rate of 100 per day, and have a unit cost

    less than a preestablished amount. Because the team could measure its progress against

    each of these specific objectives, the team knew throughout the development process where

    it stood. Either it had achieved its goals or not.</li>

  <li>As Outward Bound and other team-building programs illustrate, specific objectives have a

    leveling effect conducive to team behavior. When a small group of people challenge

    themselves to get over a wall or to reduce cycle time by 50%, their respective titles,

    perks, and other stripes fade into the background. The teams that succeed evaluate what

    and how each individual can best contribute to the team's goal and, more important, do so

    in terms of the performance objective itself rather than a person's status or personality.</li>

  <li>Specific goals allow a team to achieve small wins as it pursues its broader purpose.

    These small wins are invaluable to building commitment and overcoming the inevitable

    obstacles that get in the way of a long-term purpose. For example, the Knight-Ridder team

    mentioned at the outset turned a narrow goal to eliminate errors into a compelling

    customer-service purpose.</li>

  <li>Performance goals are compelling. They are symbols of accomplishment that motivate and

    energize. They challenge the people on a team to commit themselves, as a team, to make a

    difference. Drama, urgency, and a healthy fear of failure combine to drive teams who have

    their collective eye on an attainable, but challenging, goal. Nobody but the team can make

    it happen. It is their challenge.</li>

</font></ul>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">The combination of purpose and specific goals is essential to performance. Each depends

on the other to remain relevant and vital. Clear performance goals help a team keep track

of progress and hold itself accountable; the broader, even nobler, aspirations in a team's

purpose supply both meaning and emotional energy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><big><big>V</big></big></strong>irtually all effective teams we have met, read

or heard about, or been members of have ranged between 2 and 25 people. For example, the

Burlington Northern "piggybacking" team had 7 members, the Knight-Ridder

newspaper team, 14. The majority of them have numbered less than 10. Small size is

admittedly more of a pragmatic guide than an absolute necessity for success. A large

number of people, say 50 or more, can theoretically become a team. But groups of such size

are more likely to break into subteams rather than function as a single unit.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Why? Large numbers of people have trouble interacting constructively as a group, much

less doing real work together. Ten people are far more likely than fifty are to work

through their individual, functional, and hierarchical differences toward a common plan

and to hold themselves jointly accountable for the results.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Large groups also face logistical issues, such as finding enough physical space and

time to meet. And they confront more complex constraints, like crowd or herd behaviors,

which prevent the intense sharing of viewpoints needed to build a team. As a result, when

they try to develop a common purpose, they usually produce only superficial

"missions" and well-meaning intentions that cannot be translated into concrete

objectives. They tend fairly quickly to reach a point when meetings become a chore, a

clear sign that most of the people in the group are uncertain why they have gathered,

beyond some notion of getting along better. Anyone who has been through one of these

exercises knows how frustrating it can be. This kind of failure tends to foster cynicism,

which gets in the way of future team efforts.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to finding the right size, teams must develop the right mix of skills, that

is, each of the complementary skills necessary to do the team's job. As obvious as it

sounds, it is a common falling in potential teams. Skill requirements fall into three

fairly self-evident categories:</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Technical or functional expertise</em>. It would make little sense for a group of

doctors to litigate an employment discrimination case in a court of law. Yet teams of

doctors and lawyers often try medical malpractice or personal injury cases. Similarly,

product-development groups that include only marketers or engineers are less likely to

succeed than those with the complementary skills of both.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Problem-solving and decision-making skills</em>. Teams must be able to identify the

problems and opportunities they face, evaluate the options they have for moving forward,

and then make necessary trade-offs and decisions about how to proceed. Most teams need

some members with these skills to begin with, although many will develop them best on the

job.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Interpersonal skills</em>. Common understanding and purpose cannot arise without

effective communication and constructive conflict, which in turn depend on interpersonal

skills. These include risk taking, helpful criticism, objectivity, active listening,

giving the benefit of the doubt, and recognizing the interests and achievements of others.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Obviously, a team cannot get started without some minimum complement of skills,

especially technical and functional ones. Still, think about how often you've been part of

a team whose members were chosen primarily on the basis of personal compatibility or

formal position in the organization, and in which the skill mix of its members wasn't

given much thought.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is equally common to overemphasize skills in team selection. Yet in all the

successful teams we've encountered, not one had all the needed skills at the outset. The

Burlington Northern team, for example, initially had no members who were skilled marketers

despite the fact that their performance challenge was a marketing one. In fact, we

discovered that teams are powerful vehicles for developing the skills needed to meet the

team's performance challenge. Accordingly, team member selection ought to ride as much on

skill potential as on skills already proven.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><big><big><strong>E</strong></big></big>ffective teams develop strong commitment to a

common approach, that is, to how they will work together to accomplish their purpose. Team

members must agree on who will do particular jobs, how schedules will be set and adhered

to, what skills need to be developed, how continuing membership in the team is to be

earned, and how the group will make and modify decisions. This element of commitment is as

important to team performance as is the team's commitment to its purpose and goals.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Agreeing on the specifics of work and how they fit together to integrate individual

skills and advance team performance lies at the heart of shaping a common approach. It is

perhaps self-evident that an approach that delegates all the real work to a few members

(or staff outsiders), and thus relies on reviews and meetings for its only "work

together" aspects, cannot sustain a real team. Every member of a successful team does

equivalent amounts of real work; all members, including the team leader, contribute in

concrete ways to the team's work-product. This is a very important element of the

emotional logic that drives team performance.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">When individuals approach a team situation, especially in a business setting, each has

preexisting job assignments as well as strengths and weaknesses reflecting a variety of

backgrounds, talents, personalities, and prejudices. Only through the mutual discovery and

understanding of how to apply all its human resources to a common purpose can a team

develop and agree on the best approach to achieve its goals. At the heart of such long

and, at times, difficult interactions lies a commitment-building process in which the team

candidly explores who is best suited to each task as well as how individual roles will

come together. In effect, the team establishes a social contract among members that

relates to their purpose and guides and obligates how they must work together.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">No group ever becomes a team until it can hold itself accountable as a team. Like

common purpose and approach, mutual accountability is a stiff test. Think, for example,

about the subtle but critical difference between "the boss holds me accountable"

and "we hold ourselves accountable." The first case can lead to the second; but

without the second, there can be no team.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Companies like Hewlett-Packard and Motorola have an ingrained performance ethic that

enables teams to form "organically" whenever there is a clear performance

challenge requiring collective rather than individual effort. In these companies, the

factor of mutual accountability is commonplace. "Being in the boat together" is

how their performance game is played.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">At its core, team accountability is about the sincere promises we make to ourselves and

others, promises that underpin two critical aspects of effective teams: commitment and

trust. Most of us enter a potential team situation cautiously because ingrained

individualism and experience discourage us from putting our fates in the hands of others

or accepting responsibility for others. Teams do not succeed by ignoring or wishing away

such behavior.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Mutual accountability cannot be coerced any more than people can be made to trust one

another. But when a team shares a common purpose, goals, and approach, mutual

accountability grows as a natural counterpart. Accountability arises from and reinforces

the time, energy, and action invested in figuring out what the team is trying to

accomplish and how best to get it done.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">When people work together toward a common objective, trust and commitment follow.

Consequently, teams enjoying a strong common purpose and approach inevitably hold

themselves responsible, both as individuals and as a team, for the team's performance.

This sense of mutual accountability also produces the rich rewards of mutual achievement

in which all members share. What we heard over and over from members of effective teams is

that they found the experience energizing and Motivating in ways that their

"normal" jobs never could match.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand, groups established primarily for the sake of becoming a team or for

job enhancement, communication, organizational effectiveness, or excellence rarely become

effective teams, as demonstrated by the bad feelings left in many companies after

experimenting with quality circles that never translated "quality" into specific

goals. Only when appropriate performance goals are set does the process of discussing the

goals and the approaches to them give team members a clearer and clearer choice: they can

disagree with a goal and the path that the team selects and, in effect, opt out, or they

can pitch in and become accountable with and to their teammates.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><big><big>T</big></big></strong>he discipline of teams we've outlined is

critical to the success of all teams. Yet it is also useful to go one step further. Most

teams can be classified in one of three ways: teams that recommend things, teams that make

or do things, and teams that run things. In our experience, each type faces a

characteristic set of challenges.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Teams that recommend things</em>. These teams include task forces, project groups,

and audit, quality, or safety groups asked to study and solve particular problems. Teams

that recommend things almost always have predetermined completion dates. Two critical

issues are unique to such teams: getting off to a fast and constructive start and dealing

with the ultimate handoff required to get recommendations implemented.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">The key to the first issue lies in the clarity of the team's charter and the

composition of its membership. In addition to wanting to know why and how their efforts

are important, task forces need a clear definition of whom management expects to

participate and the time commitment required. Management can help by ensuring that the

team includes people with the skills and influence necessary for crafting practical

recommendations that will carry weight throughout the organization. Moreover, management

can help the team get the necessary cooperation by opening doors and dealing with

political obstacles.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Missing the handoff is almost always the problem that stymies teams that recommend

things. To avoid this, the transfer of responsibility for recommendations to those who

must implement them demands top management's time and attention. The more top managers

assume that recommendations will "Just happen," the less likely it is that they

will. The more involvement task force members have in implementing their recommendations,

the more likely they are to get implemented.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">To the extent that people outside the task force will have to carry the ball, it is

critical to involve them in the process early and often, certainly well before

recommendations are finalized. Such involvement may take many forms, including

participating in interviews, helping with analyses, contributing and critiquing ideas, and

conducting experiments and trials. At a minimum, anyone responsible for implementation

should receive a briefing on the task force's purpose, approach, and objectives at the

beginning of the effort as well as regular reviews of progress.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Teams that make or do things</em>. These teams include people at or near the front

lines who are responsible for doing the basic manufacturing, development, operations,

marketing, sales, service, and other value-adding activities of a business. With some

exceptions, like new-product development or process design teams, teams that make or do

things tend to have no set completion dates because their activities are ongoing.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">In deciding where team performance might have the greatest impact, top management

should concentrate on what we call the company's "critical delivery points,"

that is, places in the organization where the cost and value of the company's products and

services are most directly determined. Such critical delivery points might include where

accounts get managed, customer service performed, products designed, and productivity

determined. If performance at critical delivery points depends on combining multiple

skills, perspectives, and judgments in real time, then the team option is the smartest

one.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">When an organization does require a significant number of teams at these points, the

sheer challenge of maximizing the performance of so many groups will demand a carefully

constructed and performance-focused set of management processes. The issue here for top

management is how to build the necessary systems and process supports without falling into

the trap of appearing to promote teams for their own sake.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">The imperative here, returning to our earlier discussion of the basic discipline of

teams, is a relentless focus on performance. If management fails to pay persistent

attention to the link between teams and performance, the organization becomes convinced

that "this year we are doing 'teams.'" Topmanagement can help by instituting

processes like pay schemes and training for teams responsive to their real time needs, but

more than anything else, top management must make clear and compelling demands on the

teams themselves and then pay constant attention to their progress with respect to both

team basics and performance results. This means focusing on specific teams and specific

performance challenges. Otherwise "performance," like "team," will

become a cliche.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Teams that run things</em>. Despite the fact that many leaders refer to the group

reporting to them as a team, few groups really are. And groups that become real teams

seldom think of themselves as a team because they are so focused on performance results.

Yet the opportunity for such teams includes groups from the top of the enterprise down

through the divisional or functional level. Whether it is in charge of thousands of people

or a handful, as long as the group oversees some business, ongoing program, or significant

functional activity, it is a team that runs things.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">The main issue these teams face is determining whether a real team approach is the

right one. Many groups that run things can be more effective as working groups than as

teams. The key judgment is whether the sum of individual bests will suffice for the

performance challenge at hand or whether the group must deliver substantial incremental

performance requiring real, joint work-products. Although the team option promises greater

performance, it also brings more risk, and managers must be brutally honest in assessing

the trade-offs.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Members may have to overcome a natural reluctance to trust their fate to others. The

price of faking the team approach is high: at best, members get diverted from their

individual goals, costs outweigh benefits, and people resent the imposition on their time

and priorities; at worst, serious animosities develop that undercut even the potential

personal bests of the working-group approach.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Working groups present fewer risks. Effective working groups need little time to shape

their purpose since the leader usually establishes it. Meetings are run against

well-prioritized agendas. And decisions are implemented through specific individual

assignments and accountabilities. Most of the time, therefore, if performance aspirations

can be met through individuals doing their respective jobs well, the working-group

approach is more comfortable, less risky, and less disruptive than trying for more elusive

team performance levels. Indeed, if there is no performance need for the team approach,

efforts spent to improve the effectiveness of the working group make much more sense than

floundering around trying to become a team.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Having said that, we believe the extra level of performance teams can achieve is

becoming critical for a growing number of companies, especially as they move through major

changes during which company performance depends on broad-based behavioral change. When

top management uses teams to run things, it should make sure the team succeeds in

identifying specific purposes and goals.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a second major issue for teams that run things. Too often, such teams confuse

the broad mission of the total organization with the specific purpose of their small group

at the top. The discipline of teams tells us that for a real team to form there must be a <em>team</em>

purpose that is distinctive and specific to the small group and that requires its members

to roll up their sleeves and accomplish something beyond individual end-products. If a

group of managers looks only at the economic performance of the part of the organization

it runs to assess overall effectiveness, the group will not have any team performance

goals of its own.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">While the basic discipline of teams does not differ for them, teams at the top are

certainly the most difficult. The complexities of long-term challenges, heavy demands on

executive time, and the deepseated individualism of senior people conspire against teams

at the top. At the same time, teams at the top are the most powerful. At first we thought

such teams were nearly impossible. That is because we were looking at the teams as defined

by the formal organizational structure, that is, the leader and all his or her direct

reports equals the team. Then we discovered that real teams at the top were often smaller

and less formalized - Whitehead and Weinberg at Goldman, Sachs; Hewlett and Packard at HP;

Krasnoff, Pall, and Hardy at Pall Corp; Kendall, Pearson, and Calloway at Pepsi; Haas and

Haas at Levi Strauss; Batten and Ridder at Knight-Ridder. They were mostly twos and

threes, with an occasional fourth.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Nonetheless, real teams at the top of large, complex organizations are still few and

far between. Far too many groups at the top of large corporations needlessly constrain

themselves from achieving real team levels of performance because they assume that all

direct reports must be on the team; that team goals must be identical to corporate goals;

that the team members' positions rather than skills determine their respective roles; that

a team must be a team all the time; and that the team leader is above doing real work.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">As understandable as these assumptions may be, most of them are unwarranted. They do

not apply to the teams at the top we have observed, and when replaced with more realistic

and flexible assumptions that permit the team discipline to be applied, real team

performance at the top can and does occur. Moreover, as more and more companies are

confronted with the need to manage major change across their organizations, we will see

more real teams at the top.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><big><big><strong>W</strong></big></big>e believe that teams will become the primary

unit of performance in high-performance organizations. But that does not mean that teams

will crowd out individual opportunity or formal hierarchy and process. Rather, teams will

enhance existing structures without replacing them. A team opportunity exists anywhere

hierarchy or organizational boundaries inhibit the skills and perspectives needed for

optimal results. Thus, new-product innovation requires preserving functional excellence

through structure while eradicating functional bias through teams. And frontline

productivity requires preserving direction and guidance through hierarchy while drawing on

energy and flexibility through self-managing teams.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">We are convinced that every company faces specific performance challenges for which

teams are the most practical and powerful vehicle at top management's disposal. The

critical role for senior managers, therefore, is to worry about company performance and

the kinds of teams that can deliver it. This means that top management must recognize a

team's unique potential to deliver results, deploy teams strategically when they are the

best tool for the job, and foster the basic discipline of teams that will make them

effective. By doing so, top management creates the kind of environment that enables team

as well as individual and organizational performance.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><big><strong>Building Team Performance</strong></big></font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman">Although there is no guaranteed how-to recipe for building team performance, we

observed a number of approaches shared by many successful teams.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Establish urgency, demanding performance standards, and direction</em>. All team

members need to believe the team has urgent and worthwhile purposes, and they want to know

what the expectations are. Indeed, the more urgent and meaningful the rationale, the more

likely it is that the team will live up to its performance potential, as was the case for

a customerservice team that was told that further growth for the entire company would be

impossible without major improvements in that area. Teams work best in a compelling

context. That is why companies with strong performance ethics usually form teams readily.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Select members for skill and skill potential, not personality</em>. No team

succeeds without all the skills needed to meet its purpose and performance goals. Yet most

teams figure out the skills they will need after they are formed. The wise manager will

choose people both for their existing skills and their potential to improve existing

skills and learn new ones. Pay particular. attention to first meetings and actions.

Initial impressions always mean a great deal. When potential teams first gather, everyone

monitors the signals given by others to confirm, suspend, or dispel assumptions and

concerns. They pay particular attention to those in authority - the team leader and any

executives - who set up, oversee, or other-wise influence the team. And, as always, what

such leaders do is more important than what they say. If a senior executive leaves the

team kickoff to take a phone call ten minutes after the session has begun and he never

returns, people get the message.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Set some clear rules of behavior</em>. All effective teams develop rules of conduct

at the outset to help them achieve their purpose and performance goals. The most critical

initial rules pertain to attendance (for example, "no interruptions to take phone

calls"), discussion ("no sacred cows"), confidentiality ("the only

things to leave this room are what we agree on"), analytic approach ("facts are

friendly"), end-product orientation ("everyone gets assignments and does

them"), constructive confrontation ("no finger-pointing"), and, often the

most important, contributions ("everyone does real work").</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Set and seize upon a few immediate performance-oriented tasks and goals</em>. Most

effective teams trace their advancement to key performance-oriented events. Such events

can be set in motion by immediately establishing a. few challenging goals that can be

reached early on. There is no such thing as a real team without performance results, so

the sooner such results occur, the sooner the team congeals.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Challenge the group regularly with fresh facts and information</em>. New

information causes a team to redefine and enrich its understanding of the performance

challenge, thereby helping the team shape a common purpose, set clearer goals, and improve

its common approach. A plant quality improvement team knew the cost of poor quality was

high, but it wasn't until they researched the different types of defects and put a price

tag on each one that they knew where to go next. Conversely, teams err when they assume

that all the information needed exists in the collective experience and knowledge of their

members.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Spend lots of time together</em>. Common sense tells us that team members must

spend a lot of time together, scheduled and unscheduled, especially in the beginning.

Indeed, creative insights as well as personal bonding require impromptu and casual

interactions just as much as analyzing spreadsheets and interviewing customers. Busy

executives and managers too often intentionally minimize the time they spend together. The

successful teams we've observed all gave themselves the time to learn to be a team. This

time need not always be spent together physically; electronic, fax, and phone time can

also count as time spent together.</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Exploit the power of positive feedback, recognition, and reward</em>. Positive

reinforcement works as well in a team context as elsewhere. "Giving out gold

stars" helps to shape new behaviors critical to team performance. If people in the

group, for example, are alert to a shy person's initial efforts to speak up and

contribute, they can give the honest positive reinforcement that encourages continued

contributions. There are many ways to recognize and reward team performance beyond direct

compensation, from having a senior executive speak directly to the team about the urgency

of its mission to using awards to recognize contributions. Ultimately, however, the

satisfaction shared by a team in its own performance becomes the most cherished reward.</font></p>
